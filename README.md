# RPGMe
RPGMe is a GroupMe bot that runs a text based adventure in your GroupMe chats through a locally hosted server (heroku friendly app maybe in the future?). While still at a primitive stage, the hope is to equip RPGMe with multiplayer support, multiple story routes, and detailed documentation of the game's world using a glossary-like command allowing the player to learn what they want by simply asking about a term.
